Every morning Raffaella has to create a production plan which contains how many of each product to produce that day.

She makes this plan taking into account the following factors:
- the production plan for the same day of the previous year
- the products that have to be manufactured that day to fulfil new orders considering the ripening time of each cheese type
  For instance, a caciotta takes seven days to ripen, so the production has to start seven days before the order's deadline.
- the products needed to replenish the stock.

> 💡 The completed production plan is sent to the production B.C.
