# Licence
Even though in a realistic scenario we would have opted for a closed project, for the academic purpose we 
decided to use the [Apache Licence 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).  
This is necessary since in the codebase there are some references to the Mambelli trademark and the Apache licence
limits trademarks use.
