# Licence

In a realistic scenario we would have opted for a closed project. However, for academic purposes,
we decided to keep the project open; this way we could
[freely use GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

We decided the open licence that best suit our needs was the
[Apache Licence 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Indeed, our codebase could contain
refences to the Mambelli trademark and this licence, does not grant permission to use the trade
names contained in the codebase
_"...except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work..."_
