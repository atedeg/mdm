# MDM - Mambelli Domain Model

This is the documentation for the final project of the
[2021/2022 LSS exam](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2021/412677).

We decided to model the domain of the Mambelli cheese factory since one of the
team members is the son of the factory owners and they were kind enough to
help us and participate in the project's development as domain experts.
We also happen to love cheese so that's a win-win! ðŸ§€

The project's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/atedeg/mdm).
