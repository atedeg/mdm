# Stocking

After a batch of cheeses has ripened for the required amount of time,
one of them is selected to perform quality assurance.
Its result could be either positive or negative.
The former results in the cheeses being wrapped, labelled and put in the refrigeration room;
the latter results in the entire batch being discarded.

To label a cheese the worker has to weigh it, and an automated system will print an appropriate label.
