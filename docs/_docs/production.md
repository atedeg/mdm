# Production
Every day the dairyman receives instructions from Raffaella on the cheese he needs to
produce for the day. A production specifies the quantity of a product that needs to 
be produced. Each type of cheese has a recipe which has different lines that specify
the  quintals of each ingredient needed to produce a quintal of the given type of
cheese.
> _e.g._ The recipe for a quintal of ricotta requires 1.5 quintals of milk
> a tenth of quintal of rennet and a tenth of quintal of salt 

Once the appropriate recipe is chosen the production can start by retrieving the
needed ingredients.

Once an in-progress production ends (the smart machines will send an appropriate message
to signal the end of the process), the produced cheese is assigned a lot number
and stored in a refrigeration room.
